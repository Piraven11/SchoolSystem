This is a project for the final in introduction to program

This project mimic a school system works.It uses programming to make school things, like departments, students, courses, and assignments.
Each part has an automatic ID so that every student, course, and assignment is unique. The program also shows how these parts connect, 
like how students belong to courses and courses belong to departments.

With this program, a user can set up a small school environment. They can create students, courses, and assignments,
and give each assignment a weight for the final grade. The program also helps with grading. When a student signs up for a course, 
the program automatically creates empty space for their assignment scores. It can give random scores
for students’ assignments so you can test the system. Then it calculates each student’s final grade using the weights
of the assignments. At the end, it can make reports that show tables of all assignment scores, the average score of
each assignment, and the final grade for every student. So the user can see how each student is doing in their courses.
